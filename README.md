## 👋 Hi, I’m Alin 
#### Im a just a coder turned **AI** and **Game Dev**. I've transitioned from a solid background in full-stack web development to focusing on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), all while crafting video games that I hope you'll love.

### 🤖 My AI Skills:
 - Im working to create a **GPT Model** 🏗️
 - During this process I learned how to use Pytorch 🧰
 - I can create neural networks 🧠
 - I can train a model and a set of data `ie. gradient descent` 📖
> for this I used Python 🐍 and pytorch


### 🎮 My Game Dev Skills:
 -  **Unity**:
     - I created a 2D platformer with Unity for android
     - Its main features were: Multiple Levels, VFX and SFX, Animations, Cinematics and Adds
     - The game was even launched on androind market for a while
 -  **Unreal 5**:
     - I am working to recreate Assassins Creed and GTA 5 in Unreal
     - I familiarized myself with the Blueprint technology
     - I learned how to use animation in different ways
     - I'm learning how to scale different systems such as: inventory, interactions, AI behaviour
> For these I used C# in Unity and Blueprints in Unreal

### 🕸️ My Web Skills:
 - I created Many Web projects:
   - **Reac**t apps
   -  **.NET** Backend with React Frontend 
   - **Flask** Backend with React Frontend
- I implemented different types of authentication
- I experimented with different backend design patterns such as: `Controller Service Repository` or `Model View Controller`
> For these I used JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, C#, Css and i experimented with many of their frameworks

#### I currently learning some advance mathematics from Briliant.org to help my Game and AI dev path and I also expand my knowladge in these areas by constantly working on my personal projects, My dream is that one day I may be able to add AI entities to videogames in order to make them as immersive as possible, or even simulate different kinds of worlds that may give us the answer to how can we become an Utopia
